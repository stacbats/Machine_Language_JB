# Machine_Language_JB
All from the book by Jim Buterfield

This book introduces beginners to the principles of machine language: what it is, how it works, and how to program with it.
It is based on an intensive two-day course on machine language that has been presented many times over the past five years.
Readers of this book should have a computer on hand: students will learn by doing, not just by reading. Upon completing the
tutorial material in this book, the reader will have a good idea of the fundamentals of machine language. There will
be more to be learned; but by this time, students should understand how to adapt other material from books and magazines
to their own particular computers.

This book is primarily tutorial in nature. It contains, however, extensive reference material, which the reader will want to
continue to use. No previous machine language experience is required. It is useful if the reader has had some background in
programming in other languages, so that concepts such as loops and decisions are understood.
